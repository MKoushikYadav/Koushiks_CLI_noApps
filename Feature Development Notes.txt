Console.js  Line 108 function getCommandFromHistory()

When previous event is arrowUp and currentEvent is also arrow arrowUp

Desired Effect: Use previous command Index and decrement count

Current Effect: Uses a localized command Index initialized to CommandhistoryLength




Desired Effect:

        when count = 0; HistoryLen = 0; Up Arrow Does nothing; Array = []
        when count = 0; HistoryLen = 2; Up Arrow Does count--; Array =[1,2]. shows Array[count] = array[1] -> f(2-1) =1
        when count = -1; HistoryLen = 2;Up Arrow Does count--; Array = [1,2]. shows Array[count] = array[0] -> f(2-2) =0
        when count = -2; HistoryLen=2; Up Arrow Does'nt count -- as count==history. Return Integer;
        Down Arrow does count++;

        when count = -2;HistoryLen=2;Down Arrow Does count++; Array=[1,2]. shows Array[count]= array[1] -> f(2-1)=1
        when count = -1;HistoryLen=2;Down Arrow Does'nt count as count as count==-1

        Formula = Array[length+count]
